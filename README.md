# C# Course Assignments - Python Implementations

## Overview
This repository contains my implementations of C# course assignments, recreated in Python. While the original assignments are part of a C# programming course, I've chosen to implement them in Python to demonstrate programming concept understanding across different languages and to explore different approaches to solving the same problems.

## Purpose
The main objectives of this repository are:
- Practice core programming concepts in multiple languages
- Demonstrate language-agnostic problem-solving skills
- Compare implementation approaches between C# and Python
- Document my learning journey across different programming paradigms

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Standard Python libraries
- Git for version control

## Repository Structure

```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system
3. Navigate to specific assignment directories to run individual projects

## Development Approach
Each implementation maintains the core requirements of the original C# assignments while utilizing Python's strengths and conventions. The code demonstrates understanding of:
- Program flow control
- Data structures
- Object-oriented programming
- Algorithm implementation
- Best practices in both languages
