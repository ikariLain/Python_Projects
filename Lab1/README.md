# Lab 1 - My First Program

## About the Assignment
This is the first assignment in the course. Wohoo! ðŸ¥³

This is a very simple assignment that basically tests basic programming concepts. While the original assignment was designed for C#, this is a Python implementation demonstrating the same programming concepts.

## Assignment Requirements

The program should:
- Create a variable storing a number of your choice (hardcoded, not user input)
- Create an if-statement checking if the number is above 10
  - If the number is above 10, print "The number is big!"
  - Otherwise print "Oh. Low number!"
- Print "What's your name?" and let the user input their name
- Print "Hej [name]!" where [name] is replaced with the user's input
- Create a loop that prints all numbers from zero up to the number stored in the variable
- Include comments in the code explaining what it does
- Include a comment at the top of the code with your name and class

## Technical Requirements
1. All code should be in a single Python file
2. Code (variable names, comments, etc.) should be written in English
3. Comments in the code should be in English

## Example Output
Here's an example of what the program output should look like if the number is 11 and the user enters the name "Tobias":

```
The nummber is big!
What's your name?
Tobias
Hi Tobias!

```

## Installation and Running
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. Clone this repository
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python first_program.py
   ```

## Implementation Notes
- The program is implemented in Python while maintaining the original assignment requirements
- Code follows Python best practices and conventions
- Comments are included for code clarity
